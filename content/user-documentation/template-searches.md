### What is a template search
A template search is a pre-defined query that we have created for you. A template search allows you to search the database without having to construct your own query or understand the underlying data structure. A library of template searches covering the full range of data is available.

A template search consists of a simple form with one or more options for you to enter or select. Default values are always provided so you can immediately run them and see if they return the data you are after.

Each template has a short name and a longer description. We provide a short name so you can quickly scan the available searches and find the one that you need. The longer description will provide you with more details and any limitations to the values you can enter.

### Steps to finding a template search
