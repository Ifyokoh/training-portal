<a href="http://www.intermine.org/" style="color:blue;">InterMine</a> is an open source data warehouse build specifically for the integration and analysis of complex biological data.


<br/>
Developed by the <a href="http://www.micklemlab.org/">Micklem lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>. 
InterMine enables the creation of biological databases accessed by sophisticated web query tools. Parsers are provided for integrating data from many common biological data sources and formats, and there is a framework for adding your own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web interface that works ‘out of the box’ and can be easily customised for your specific needs, as well as a powerful, scriptable web-service API to allow programmatic access to your data.
